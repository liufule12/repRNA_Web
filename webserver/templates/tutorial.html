            <p>The repRNA web server has a simple user interface that consists of three input fields: (1) selection of feature vector mode, (2) parameter settings, and (3) sequence to be analyzed. Users should first select any one of the 14 feature-vector modes according to their need, followed by setting the corresponding parameters. The RNA sequences should be in FASTA format and they can be input by the way of either copy/paste or uploading a file containing the sequences concerned. To see the input sequence format, click the Example button. The web server accepts as many as 100 input sequences for each submission.</p>
            <p>After clicking the Submit button, if your input contains any invalid stuff, an error message will be prompted; otherwise, you will see the output on the screen. The output generated by the repRNA server contains a parame-ter summery and a result section. The former lists all the selected parame-ters used for deriving the feature vectors; the latter shows the numerical feature vectors thus obtained for the corresponding RNA sequences in the input. The feature vectors can be downloaded into a separate file suitable for downstream computational analyses by various algorithms, such support vector machine, neural network, and covariant discriminant algorithm. For all the 14 modes, the resultant feature vectors can be visualized by an intuitive graphical representation called 'heat map' to see the distributions of their feature values. For the three modes in the structure composition category, the secondary structures of the input RNA sequences can also be visualized to see their structure characteristics.</p>
