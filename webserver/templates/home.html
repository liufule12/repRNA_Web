            <p>To expedite the process of analyzing the avalanche of RNA sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to represent them, according to the different analyzing focuses, with various modes of feature vectors that can capture their relevant key features and sequence patterns. Unfortunately so far only one method can be used in this regard, and it is limited to certain types of features and a small number of physicochemical properties. In view of this, we are proposing a new web server, called "<strong>representations of RNA sequences</strong>" (<strong>repRNA</strong>).</p>
            <p>Compared with the existing method, repRNA is much more comprehensive, flexible and power-ful, as reflected by the following facts:</p>
            <p>(1) it can generate 14 different modes of feature vectors for users to choose according to their investigation purposes;
            <br>(2) it allows users to select the features from 22 built-in physicochemical properties and even those defined by users' own;
            <br>(3) the resultant feature vectors and the secondary structures of the corresponding RNA sequences can be visualized.</p>
